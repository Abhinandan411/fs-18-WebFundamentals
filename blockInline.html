    <!-- Block elements: which take up whole space for themselves. Two block elements can never occur side by side.
    Ex: p, ul, ol, li, table, div, semantic, h1...h6, form, br, hr

    <!-- Inline elements: which take upthat much space as their content. Two inline elements always occur side by side. 
    Ex: span, a, img, input, label
